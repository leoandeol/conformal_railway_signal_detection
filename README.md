# Confident Object Detection via Conformal Prediction and Conformal Risk Control: an Application to Railway Signaling
Link to the preprint on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06052), submitted to COPA 2022.

The code to reproduce experiments is in the notebook, and is based on a small purpose-built library for conformal object detection.

The requirements are listed in requirements.txt and can be installed by "pip install -r requirements.txt".

The dataset used in our experiments will be published soon separately, and other datasets can be tested easily using our code.
